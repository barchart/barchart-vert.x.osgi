Instructions for creating an OSGi bundle from vert.x-core.jar

Run bundling/bundlor-1.1.0.M04/bin/bundlor.sh along the following lines:

bundlor.sh -i vert.x-1.0.final/lib/jars/vert.x-core.jar -m ./vertx.core.mf -o ./vert.x-core-1.0.0.final.jar

Note: You'll need to download vert.x 1.0-final. The above command needs absolute paths to be passed in.
